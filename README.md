🌊 Benthic Megafauna AI DetectorA specialized UI for marine scientists to detect, count, and catalog seafloor megafauna from image surveys and ROV video footage.This application provides a "point-and-click" dashboard for your trained YOLOv8 models. It is designed for ecological research, allowing you to process large datasets without writing code, while providing real-time abundance statistics and standardized data exports.✨ FeaturesOS Agnostic: Runs natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux/WSL.Dual Media Support: Process folders containing both static images (.jpg, .png) and high-resolution videos (.mp4, .avi, .mov).Real-time Dashboard: Watch a live feed of detections and track cumulative species abundance as the batch processes.Scientific Export: Automatically generates a detailed detection_report.csv containing species names, confidence scores, and frame/coordinate metadata.Safe-Save Mode: Every run creates a new timestamped folder, ensuring you never accidentally overwrite previous survey results.🛠️ Installation (Recommended: Conda)We recommend using Miniconda to manage the software. This keeps the AI libraries isolated so they don't interfere with your other computer applications.1. Prerequisite: Install MinicondaIf you don't have it, download and install the version for your OS:Download Miniconda here2. Download this ProjectClone the repository or download the ZIP and extract it to your preferred location (e.g., Desktop/Benthic_AI).3. Setup the EnvironmentOpen your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows), navigate to the folder, and run:# Create the specialized environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate benthic_env
🚀 How to Launch the ToolEvery time you want to use the tool:Open your Terminal or Anaconda Prompt.Type:conda activate benthic_env
streamlit run app.py
The dashboard will automatically open in your default web browser.Windows Pro-Tip: You can double-click the Launch_Benthic_AI.bat file in the project folder to start the app instantly without typing any commands.🖥️ Using the DashboardSelect Folders: Paste the path to your Input folder (raw data) and Output folder (where results go).Set Confidence: Adjust the slider to determine how strict the AI should be.Low (0.25): More likely to catch everything, but may have some false detections.High (0.50): Very strict; only logs detections it is "sure" about.Optimize Video: For faster video processing, increase the Frame Stride (e.g., to 5 or 10) to skip identical frames while the ROV is moving slowly.Click Start: Watch the live feed. Once complete, your data will be waiting in the output folder.📊 Understanding Your OutputInside your timestamped results folder (e.g., Run_2026-02-05_14-30), you will find:detection_report.csv: A master spreadsheet for your statistical analysis.Annotated Media: Copies of your input files with boxes and labels drawn around the detected megafauna.CSV Column Reference:ColumnDescriptionFileThe original image or video filename.TypeWhether the detection was in an Image or Video.SpeciesThe taxonomic class identified by the model.ConfidenceHow certain the AI is (0.0 to 1.0).Frame_IndexFor videos, the specific frame where the detection occurred.📝 Citation & ResearchIf you use this tool for your research, please ensure you cite both the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework and your specific model training protocol.Questions?
